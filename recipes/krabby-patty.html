        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Think jelly and burgers don't mix? I took Spongebob's invention as a challenge, and found they go together very well. The secret is to use the jelly to caramelize onion slices. You end up with a super flavorful patty topping! Yum!</p>
        <p>This is such an easy trick to spice up homemade burgers. I'm going to make them this way from now on!</p>

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 onion (large)</li>
            <li>oil</li>
            <li>3-4 tbsp. of water</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp. of grape jelly</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bell peppers (minced)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. of cilantro (chopped)</li>
            <li>1 lb. of ground chicken, turkey or beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of bread crumbs</li>
            <li>6 mini sesame buns</li>
            <li>6 cheese slices</li>
            <li>6 tomato slices</li>
            <li>lettuce (at least three large leaves)</li>
            <li>pickle</li>
            <li>condiments (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Procedure</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop onions into long, thin slices. Fry slices over low heat, until soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Stir in water and jelly. Mix very well until jelly combines with water.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have caramelized and most of the water has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make burgers by combining egg, meat, cilantro, and bell peppers. Add breadcrumbs until mixture is dry enough to shape.</li>
            <li>Divide mixture into rounds and flatten into 6 patties.</li>
            <li>Grill burgers on each side until cooked through. Transfer to prepared plate.</li>
            <li>
                Layer each burger as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Bottom bun</li>
                    <li>Your choice of ketchup, mayo, or mustard (or all three!)</li>
                    <li>Patty</li>
                    <li>Cheese slice</li>
                    <li>Pickles</li>
                    <li>Lettuce</li>
                    <li>Caramelized onions</li>
                    <li>Tomato slice</li>
                    <li>Top bun</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Serve, and enjoy the taste of natural jelly.</li>
        </ol>
